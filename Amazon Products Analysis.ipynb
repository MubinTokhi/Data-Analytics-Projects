    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Sales Analysis:\r\n",
    "We delved into understanding which products are dominating our sales figures. By meticulously analyzing sales data, we aimed to identify the top-performing produnue.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Product Recommendations:\r\n",
    "Leveraging the sales insights, we determined optimal product recommendations for our customers. This strategic approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also maximizes cross-selling opptrtunind needs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Product Reviews Analysis:\r\n",
    "A comprehensive examination of product reviews was conducted to identify areas of improvement. Products with negative reviews and lower purchase rates were flagged for further investigation, allowing us to make informed decisions about inventory management.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "User Segmentation:\r\n",
    "The project involved segregating users into frequent and non-frequent categories based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation enabled us to pinpoint customers who are more likely to make repeated purchases, allowing us to offer targeted discounts or coupons to enhance customer loyalty.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Discount and Coupon Strategy:\r\n",
    "By analyzing frequent users, we developed a data-driven strategy to offer discounts or coupons to those customers who contribute significantly to our sales. This personalized approach aims to foster customer loyalty and satisfaction.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis:\r\n",
    "The sentiment analysis component focused on understanding the emotions and attitudes expressed in product-related content. This information is invaluable for gauging customer satisfaction and refining our products and services.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Outcome:\r\n",
    "This project culminated in a holistic understanding of our product landscape, customer behaviors, and market dynamics. The insights derived from this analysis empower us to make informed decisions that optimize our product inventory, refine advertising strategies, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.\n",

Better than it looks... Serve On the Rocks Good \"natural\" soda Nice Flavor, but Not Much To It A healthier alternative to soda, but not overly original Bright and effervescent A nice blend Quite refreshing, great taste Pretty Good... Not for me... Tasty, but I\\'m not planning to switch very different... Not to sweet thirst quencher Great alternative to orange soda A Tasty, Enjoyable Pure Juice Carbonated Drink Nice Drink Bubbly Tangerine slice refreshment Just OK Bubble liquid Gets an A-plus for 100% juice and no HFCS very popular at my house Too much orange, not enough tangerine. Artificial tasting Excellent choice Nice tasting drink Too sweet, too expensive, too much packaging Sweet and definitely full of tangerine goodness~ Flavor with fizz Good stuff Tastes like an energy drink No point in having carbonated juice Orange-Tangerine Carbonated Fruit Drink Tangy and Pleasingly \"Real\" carbonated juice beats sodas Soda Juice II It was - Ok... Didn\\'t like the flavor, aftertaste, or quantity Suprisingly rich flavor Really Good Tastes like Orange Crush but without the Sugar/Corn Syrup AN EXTREMELY PLEASANT CARBONATED DRINK! Tastes Like Carbonated Tang Small can Not for me Fizzy Citrus Fruity and bubbly, not so orangy Better than expected If only it were diet too! It\\'s OK, but I prefer the Tropicana version. A tad syrupy Great taste - not overly sweet A decent diversion if you\\'re tired of colas... \"Switch\" to a \"Real\" Energy Drink Sweet fizzy juice product Tasty but too petite for me. This drink is perfect and that\\'s just that Yum - carbonated fruit juice Surprisingly good for a \"soda\"... Decent enough, but pricey Overly sweet orange soda A Tasty, Mildly Carbonated Fruit Juice Soda kind of like faygo or slice Switch to The Switch Good alternative to regular orange soda tinged with vitamin C Metallic, Sweet, Bad Aftertaste Great orange soda without being too sweet Kids love it this healthy choice Nothing Special Really VERY tasty! It\\'s good, but pretty much tastes like orange soda. Just Pretty Good Different, Maybe Better The motto of this drink fits High Sugar + Acidic Taste =  Not Ready to Make the Switch tasty, lightly carbonated, good alternative for soda-pop Mostly good Drink healthier without the YUCKY taste..but at cost. Very Tasty Soda Alternative Makes your mouth happy....and bubbly Ho-Hum, It\\'s OK. Good tasting orange soda Very good! Like an Orange juice Great flavor. Not what I expected Really good flavor.  Surprisingly soda-like for being a juice product. Not bad My favorite flavor Not too sweet, but not full juice taste ONE OF THE BETTER SPARKLING JUICES Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite Nothing like they promise, rather nasty tasting Nothing special wonderful Sweet and delicious! Light and refreshing More Like Liquid Candy in a Can! Orange Soda Flavor with Real Fruit Juice Awesome taste, and healthy too!!! Great \"natural\" orange taste, tough price Switch has true tangerine-orange flavors but it\\'s too sweet despite having \"no added sugars\". Apfelsaftschorle for Americans Switch?  Ummm ... no. The true un-soda Nothing earth-shattering; I enjoyed it, though it lacks bite Not the best Switch Flavor Thick Drink with a Strange Taste It\\'s an ok drink TOTALLY DELICIOUS Sugar-free version needed. . . A bit too sweet for my taste 100% Delicious Tastes good, but pay attention to the labels! Not as advertised sickening sweet Truly tastes like a tangerine.... Kind of taste like a cheap champagne!!! AWESOME! Soda, enriched water alternative - Tastes GREAT! Sweet treat! Pleasing Orange Soda, A Tad Pricy but worth it good, ok, maybe Flavorful, and good! Glorious The New Juice A flavor winner Very nice tangerine soda A Carbonated Juice That Tastes Like Orange Soda with a Tangy Tangerine Chaser, Fleshed Out by Filler Juices Just OK for me A drink without a category Like \"orange\" soda, only way better! Did not deliver on the hype Refreshingly Lite Natural Drink Not as tasty as it could be OK but not my fav A little funky, but not bad. Pricey sugar, okay taste Good taste but high in calorie Oranginaish Good flavor, small serving, high in calories Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either Carbonated orange juice in a can Not a fan, has an odd taste - Carbonation in minimal The Switch vs. Soda Not terrible ... but I\\'d rather just have orange juice Tasty & Not Too Sweet Syrupy tasting, Unlikeable flavor. Yuk! Enjoyable Refreshing Great Alternative to Soda REFRESHING ORANGE JUICE DRINK WITH A KICK Tasty for what it\\'s not Tasty Carbonated Orange Juice Tastes Good and Healthy and Bubbly Not a Fruit Substitute Delicious It\\'s All Juice and It\\'s All Fun! Tasted pretty much like Orange soda. It is tart! Tasty orange flavored beverage Tasty but expensive Not that great... Was not a hit at our house... Great taste, but --- Tangy, less sweet Unique and pleasing taste Great Surprise Not my favorite Tangerine juice soda Refreshing & Natural Anything Orangey, and tangeriney is worth a try! I loved it! Not for Me Yummy and fizzy! Amazing Fruit Juice Spritzer A combination of juice and carbonation, 100% juice, no sugar, no artificial flavors Fizzy and Tasty, but nothing special A good option... Fizzlicious  and tangy Delicious! Great Alternative to High Fructose Corn Syrup Laden Sodas Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff Mona Lisa Low carbonation, 100% juice Think a slightly fizzier Orangina.... light and refreshing Surprisingly tasty My least favorite of the four I tried Not so good Delicious Great Taste Not good enough for me to make The Switch Light and tasty beverage with no HFCS Tastes good but... Reminiscent of regular orange soda Switch Orange Tangerine - 8.3 Ounce Can Great fruit drink Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced **Odd**Tasting, But Natural! Not So Bold Soda Alternative tangy orange-y bubbly stuff .... yum! I wish it were either orange or tangerine. very tasty \\'natural\\' soda I wanted to like it more Tasty but Calorific Tastes almost like a \"regular\" orange/tangerine soda! Orange Tangerine Switch Too Sweet for This Sugar Freak 36g of sugar still there! Lame Yummy! Would Not Switch Unless you really want Vitamin C in your soda, not really worth it. Delicious yummy! They need to leave out the sugar, next Too Sweet Very good, could be a bit better. Very harsh, too-sweet flavor. Extra sweet and very carbonated Well it\\'s better than the black cherry anyway Not My Thing; But You Might Enjoy This is really good, especially if you like 100% juice Much better than regular soda Interesting switch from soda Medicine-like after taste I loved this drink... The Best Yet A solid juice offering Very refreshing! \"Switch Orange Tagerine\"! Sweet & Fruity \"I\\'d Rather Fight Than Switch\" A Wish for Guilt Free Flavor Refreshing, but has Unnatural Aftertaste Make the Switch to a Healthier Beverage What\\'s it all about??? I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed Tastes like soap. A ton of tangerine taste - in a tiny can! Smooth flavor Super Satisfying Taste A decent carbonated fruit drink that offers a healthier alternative to normal soda Nothing great about this Too sweet! Nothing special Refreshing! Furniture Polish with an Aftertaste Yuck! Very Juicy Like Surprisingly Good Taste as Advertised Soda Substitute that tastes Similar to the Original All natural refreshment Powerful little drink Tastes like chemicals Switch Flashback to my childhood - bad memories man Interesting. Better than Watermelon. A nice alternative to soda Tasty Orange Soda Not a soft drink, more like carbonated orange juice Fresh, light taste Excellent excellent excellent Torn No corn syrup, but way too sweet I recommend other flavors instead Crisp, and suprisingly sweet drink, but lots of calories AND pricey Too sweet to drink uncut. small size and mediocre taste Switch \"Orange Tangerine\" is misnamed...and perhaps a bit overpriced, and NOT A DIET DRINK! Yuck! Very Tasty Natural Drink Excellent Excellent!! Ok Soda--like slightly lugubrious tang in a can. Not bad.  Nothing special about it. Never received the product Not bad at all okay, but... No. It\\'s all in the numbers... Didn\\'t Taste Great! No sugar, but not low-calorie Too much sugar, too expensive Switch On A Nice Change Not bad Questionable \"healthy\" drink... It\\'s all natural, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good for you... To much and not enough... Strange... Good Ingredients, Weak Taste Healthy Drink that tastes GREAT Good for sipping - a LOT of sugar! cloying Sweet and Refreshing! A Muddy Orange Flavor Some Things Were Not Meant to be Carbonated Tasty alternative to the usual sodas Just a soda only so-so.... Meh... a great soda..... Going beyond sugar water + CO2 Nice Fruity Flavor As Jules from Pulp Fiction would say, this is a tasty beverage! Pretty good... Great alternative My Son\\'s Favorite \"Soda\" tangy Great Product! Great Orange Bevvie My kids love it... Nice Alternative Way, way, WAY too sweet - 29g of suger in a 8.3 oz can, soda doesn\\'t have this much sugar! Delightfully Delicious & Natural Tasting! Actually tastes like real oranges different than regular soda Too Sweet - Too Late A tangerine drink that doesn\\'t taste watery! Hooray for Switch! Really, just bubbles and vitamin C Tasty They got it right Exactly what is claims to be! Quite tasty & enjoyable, sweet carbonated beverage! It\\'s OK, not the best, not the worst Good but nothing special not bad but not enough zing How I miss the taste of sugar Really Not Too Bad It\\'s Okay Great Taste - Refreshing with or without Ice Excellant! Not bad, not great A fine citrus beverage from The Switch Great Taste but not New Taste Not bad.. Naturally Delicious Pricey yet surprisingly refreshing! Delicious!  And no aftertaste! Not Bad, but Not Great A Uniquely Tasty Beverage Decent, but tastes a little \"odd\" Refreshing and not too sweet Now that\\'s orange Sweet and Carbonated Like Energy Drinks but Without the Sugar Pretty good Very Good!

Too sweet and syrupy for my taste... Sweet/Tart nice carbonation - you won\\'t realize it\\'s not traditional soda tasty and effervescent... Needs a more fruity taste. Sweet enough for a 7-year-old! It\\'s okay Yummy Fizzy Deliciousness Cool refreshing Kiwi taste Switch Kiwi Berry A nice alternative to pop (as we call it here) Good balance of fizziness and 100% fruity goodness Great Flavor, A Little Too Sweet Different Great tasting spritzer Nice change from soda pop sweet but tasty Very sweet but not a lot of definitive flavor Surprisingly good and no strange aftertaste! Great! A nice treat, but no substitute Sweeeeeet! It was pretty good... It\\'s okay Sweet Too sweet for my tastes.

Pleasant tasting and refreshing Sweet Fruity Drink, Better For You Than Soft Drinks, Why Not Just Drink Water? lightly carbonated and very sweet It\\'s like Pop Rocks, in liquid form.

Refreshingly Sweet! Sweetness Overload Tasty! This is What Soda Should Be! Looking for a replacement for soda? My fav Tastes great and is better for you! Heavy on Strawberry, Light on taste Crisp taste, but high in carbs/sugars Better Than Soda Soda Juice II I like it! My family loves this drink!  Better than soda. very good A nice LITTLE drink.

WHOO WEE That is a Sweet Drink!! UNIQUE FLAVOR Great drink, healthier than sodas Good but not out of this world nice alternative to regular soda very good soda .. its something different and worth trying more sugar water! Healthy juicy soda alternative The Kiwi is a bit overpowering. Great alternative to sugary soda Switch Carbonated Juice Drink My Family Likes It. Sweet Not Syrupy Not what I grew up on The true un-soda Too sweet Did not like the taste of this I really enjoyed this flavor Apple, Grape and a touch of Kiwi-Berry Nothing special Overly sweet and too expensive Refreshingly Tasty Best one yet!

Let Me Call You Sweet/Tart Refreshingly Good Yummy Refreshing Overly Sweet, candy flavor I enjoyed it Juice, yes, but read the label carefully Ok, but a Little Too Syrupy Sweet A Switch for the better? The Switch Kiwi Berry TOO SWEET AND TOO SMALL! SWITCH!?? I THINK NOT! Too sweet and does not quench thirst Great taste, but a little too sweet Switch Beverages Have Good Flavor Guilt Free Flavor!!  (With no Soybean con attached!!) A very good thing - in a too-small package. Tastes like a cheap lollipop. Would be better without the vitamin c Very tastey Good tasting but bad for you. Why aren\\'t all packaged fruit drinks this good?! Tasty and refreshing Refreshing Too sweet 8.3 ounces of expensive mixed juice This was pretty good Drop Dead Delicious D- liscious ! love the taste A bit on the sweet side. Exactly what it states, but nothing special good; still bad for you though Tastes great but nothing like Berry or kiwi unwholesome A new taste experience GREAT portable juice, and great flavors! Excellent!! MAKE the SWITCH!!! mediocre carbonated drink \"100% if what you want, 0% of what you don\\'t\" At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For Healthy Alternative Crisp and refreshing but spendy flavorful really really tasty Nice taste, but sugar level is high Refreshing Kiwi-Berry Beverage Serviceable Substitute For Unhealthy Sodas Flavorful and Refreshing Switch Kiwi Berry Healthy perhaps, but expensive Like a cross between a soda and a juice box... A pleasant surprise and pleasure to drink. Surprisingly Good Good, But Sweet and Tart 100% Juice, so that\\'s good, right? Switch drinks Most excellent way too sweet Please, sir -- may I have some more? Great Tasting Carbonated Juice! Healthy soda taste, if that\\'s what you like... Most Excellent and Healthy Carbonated Juice! Sweet, sugary soda Refreshing taste A Berry Carbonated Fruit Juice Tasteful!

Excellent Flavor Tastes pretty good, BUT.... Not a fan of flavored carbonated water Strike Three... you\\'re out! A more portable Switch 100% Vitamin C but 34g. of sugar. Delicious! A refreshing drink Too sweet for me Good Tasting but Not Great Nothing new here. . .but it tastes good. Unbelievable good Tastes like a \"regular\" soda, but made from 100% juice! Couldn\\'t really find the Kiwi\\'s or the Strawberries Gross I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry An Alright Taste, Too Sweet False Advertising Not enough Kiwi or Berry and too much filler juices Tastes like overly sweet apple juice, Trader Joe\\'s version is better Liquid Lollipops What Do You Say After You Say It\\'s VILE 33 grams of sugar in a small can Not quite my cup of tea Kiwi, kiwi, kiwi, where? Sugar free?  Not quite. Tasty and refreshing Good drink! NO SUGAR, NO SWEETNERS Wasn\\'t for me a little metallic tasting Switch Kiwi Berry A real thirst quencher Overly sweet Great Un-Soda Tasty Good drink, something different to try rather than the usual soft drinks Tasty alternative to soda Quality is Gone FRESH TASTING AND TOP QUALITY: Great Extract with Lovely Lemon Flavor Amazon Lemon Extract Rocks!

If the rope breaks, it can be salvaged! Keeps them entertained. Good idea... my dogs are not interested. Nothing special welll very good treat dispenser Should be labled medium size dogs Good toy, but best for a clever pup Well made, but only for the very food motivated Hard to interest my pooch. It lasted a couple of hours Dog Loves it Nice enough, but... Ouch! fun but not the way intended Cute...but not Westie-proof He loves it! My dog never figured this out Cool, but my dog quickly destroyed it Okay, I Guess... The \"rope\" is actually rubber. Chewed through it in seconds. My Dog Chewed This Up not as good as the previous model Great for a food driven dog Pretty good, but doesn\\'t hold my dog\\'s interest Very engaging Better, but still room for improvement We loved it, but... rubber rope gone in 60sec Quite the workout - but maybe a bit too difficult A good little toy for every 4 legged good little girl and boy Time Consumer Not bad but could\\'ve been better Not exactly self serve Great Dane Loves It Dog loves it, but it\\'s LOUD Fun for the whole family ... excellent Rope was chewed in one day.

Good, but not for apartments VERY DISAPPOINTED My inquisitive Blue Heeler was not interested in this at all. My dog hasn\\'t gotten the hang of it yet Destructible Good idea, dog enjoyed it, broke immediately hated it I liked the design, but my pup\\'s too smart for it Best Toy Ever! Good toy Neat idea, but not good for strong chewers. Keeps her busy for a long time! Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick Wonderful attention Keeper! Keeps the pup busy Good idea, one major design flaw for us BULLET PROOF? Maybe for rubber bullets... Dog won\\'t touch it! Too small not durable for a chewer My dog now prefers this to the food bowl. Waste of money and time Clever Idea, BUT .... My puppy doesn\\'t like this...too hard to get treats out Good while it lasted ... but it didn\\'t last! Doesnt work. Nice toy but our Vizsla puppy is just not interested ??? Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy Looks like fun, but my dogs ignored it. Good concept, brittle plastic Dogs not interested Not good at all Duriable but Empties Fast Hard Plastic did not work out The lid cover broke within 5 minutes Not for a smaller dog didn\\'t last long not good for chewers Break easily Not recommended for tough chewers Awesome food toy, but not durable at all! Broke in less than a week My lab broke it within 2 days Not the toy for my dog Great but noisy and treats fall fast Dog gets distracted by the treats Less than 12 hours to chew up the rope making it useless Great--for two days Not a good treat dispenser Dog doesn\\'t use it at all Really for bigger dogs My dog loves everything, but hates this. Keeps Dog Entertained, But Too Loud not for a chewer Great idea but too hard in practice! good with some modification Only good if dog is food motivated My dog ignored it Not really interested Save your money Good concept, poor execution TUG PULL IS THIN CHEAP RUBBER, NOT A ROPE LIKE PICTURE SHOWS.

Pretty good DARK French Roast?  It\\'s bland and weak...... Good... if you need it Just OK Extremely mild taste, very low acidity Robust flavor! Mild with a nutty aroma It does as advertised! Too dark and bitter \\'French Roast\\' from Puroast A good alternative.

Great Tasting Coffee Low Acid, Smooth Taste An Excellent Low Acid Coffee Lower acid, unappealing taste Smooth, Rich, Dark Not bitter, but strangely acidic-tasting for low-acid coffee You can doll it up Good flavor but hard to judge any acid difference Very strong coffee, burnt-tasting. Makes a decent cup of coffee Good Tasting Coffee too strong & tasted yukky to me, smelled bad too. A nice, strong coffee without the stomach upset Not my cup of coffee! It does have the low acid going for it... Coffee OK but price is excessive Ehh.. Sure was hoping.... At last!!! The magic is in the grind Smooth, but with a bitter after-taste I am on the fence... Low In Acid but Low in Flavor Low marks for flavor and fragrance. Too strong pH near neutral but so is the flavor Fine for an early Saturday morning I Can Have A Second Cup!

This could be god-sent or \"donau-wasser\" depending on who you are Heaven in a cup... Hard to tell Has potential, but really doesn\\'t taste that good. Too Dark for Me but Packets Good for Christmas Baskets low flavor It says pack of 10 three ounce bags, just got one! It May Be Low Acid, but it Still Gave Me Heartburn Not the Best Part of Waking Up really good coffee and much easier on my stomach Low acid and perfect for strong coffee lovers Disappointing Coffee that\\'s low on acid, but also low on punch Puroast Low Acid Coffee Didn\\'t like the taste Low acid, high bitterness Full flavor without the burn Low Acid Coffee, lack robust favor Weak taste.

Decent flavor, not outstanding Low Acid and Little Taste no bitterness!

Mona Lisa Only a little bit more good for you than sodas The Switch...but from what? Nicely packaged bubbly applejuice Lightly carbonated 100% juice cocktail Very expensive fruit juice Good. Apple/Cherry Refreshing soda without all the bad stuff Love the Black Cherry!!! 10 yr old tried it Not as Good as Kiwi Berry A drink that lives up to its promise... Great alternative to soda Refreshing and just the right amount pleasingly natural but a bit candy-sweet This is a small portion.  Too sweet not enough tang for Cherry soda. 8.3 ounces of expensive mixed juice Juice, Natural Flavors, Carbonated to Perfection Deceptively tasty I liked another Switch, but not THIS one definitely not Shasta . . . Not bad, but it should be called \"The Switch Apple, Grape & Black Cherry\" Not too sweet with a true cherry taste weird Juice Pouch with fizz. Nice refreshing light taste Delicous-Healthy Beverage not bad but not great either The Best Switch Flavor... It\\'s tasty, but would rather drink soda A sweet but healthier alternative to Colas Carbonated Juicy Juice A refreshing marketing tool not that bubbly tasty but too sweet natural Verry cherry Excellent alternative to regular Cola - Black Cherry Switch A little lackluster Truly outstanding!! Like Drinking Cherry Pie Excellent flavor A Soda that Isn\\'t Bright, clean black cherry taste Well Whoopty Do!  Not a Good Value.  Pure Marketing Gimmick. Carbonation Makes 100 Percent Juice Lighter.  Taste is a Bit Off. Syrupy... Tasted Fermented Juice + Sparkling Water = Sparkling Taste Yet another... Wow, much better... Very enjoyable taste - too bad it has 33g of Carbs Great tasting alternative to high fructose corn syrup based sodas Not for me Pricey, Sweet, Colored Water Black Cherry Nothing that sets it apart It may be a healthier soda, but not a tastier one. Taste is only fair, not worth the money \"Really good!\" A step-down in sweetness from soda but still has a lot of sugar So what\\'cha what\\'cha what\\'cha want (what\\'cha want)? Great flavor, but too high in sugars Kiddy Soda POP Inedible! Fresh tasting soft drink - all juice, no sugar added Mild, but good flavor; more cherry smell than taste. Pricey. THE SWITCH Juice pop.  Great for cocktails! Light, Pure, But Small a very good alternative to your typical soda Very Tasty, Light and Refreshing, Small Serving At best it\\'s just OK. Surprisingly good Good Alternative to Soda Switchin\\' it up Time to make the Switch! Super Delicious Fizzy and Refreshing - Worth a Try Apple with a hint of Cherry. Tasty juice Great fruit drink Soda Juice II Delicious, but too small, but then, it\\'s just as well. Delicious Glaze Another Great Flavor. My Family Likes It. The true un-soda tasty, but full of calories The Best Drink Ever! I\\'ve \"Switched\" favorite flavor We love the black cherry! it is tasty! Not really the best of either world Juicy and Delicious Nothing Special Not the best taste Switch?  Maybe Not Delicious, but too much sugar juice ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL Black Cherry Soda without the Sugar LOVED IT!!! Pretty good stuff Cherry - Really? Pricey but delicious...! Too sweet for me Good, but nothing spectacular Why? Switch 4 1/2*  Tasting and Other Notes for \"Switch\" If You Like A Heavily Medicinal-Tasting Soft Drink With A Long-Lasting Unpleasant Aftertaste,Then Switch Black Cherry Is For You Tastes good, but so do other soft drinks. 130 calories for 8 oz of beverage Yum, but... Good taste! BLACK CHERRY No nasty artificial anything! Not a bad little drink! Better than the Orange-Tangerine version, but still a little too \"tutti fruiti\" for my taste Amazing Cherry Spritzer Great Concept, But Tastes Like You\\'re Drinking a Vitamin Not Good-tasting or Nutritious enough to make me change Okay alternative to soda Good Initial Taste My third favorite of the four I tried Not enough cherry for me Delicious and Healthy Is this what Black Cherry tastes like? Glad it\\'s natural Not too shabby..... refreshing Juice with Zing! Tastes like cherry syrup. mildly carbonated, tastes more of apple than cherry Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either Not enough Black Cherry, too much filler juices A healthy and refreshing drink It\\'s OK Good Cherry Flavor-Not Too Sweet Pleasant light fizz good- VERY cherry! Taste like fermented cherry Just \"okay\" Okay, But Could Have Better Taste (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars) Alternative to regular carbonated drinks Delicious carbonated beverage without harmful ingredients Excellent!! MAKE the SWITCH!!! Bubbly Fruit Juice If I drank more soda, I\\'d definitely make the Switch! admirable idea, but too sweet for my taste Tastes like Libby\\'s Juice + Carbonation carbonated marachino cherry juice Like a lightly carbonated kid\\'s juice box Like a frozen juice bar A refreshing drink Delicious alternative Very good! Very good soda Another Drink In The \"Switch\" Line Juicy Juice with fizz! Very Cherry Flavorful Juice Drink A tangy taste. Delicious & refreshing Sparkly Cherry Treat! don\\'t get this flavor I know it\\'s not a soda Great flavor Grown up Cherry Pop! Tastes like Juice but not a Substitute Pretty good tasting....not your everyday drink Real fruit juioce in a can WOW! GOOD STUFF! Very tasty but not overly tasty Very refreshing soda better than soda pop Nice Surprise A decent, fruity drink Loved it! A great alternative to Black Cherry Soda Tasted Great, I Only wish they gave you more A healthy alternative Black Cherry is an Awesome Who Would\\'ve Thunk Natural Juice Tastes Better Than Soda?! Pleasantly surprised An OK flavor, but not as great as I expected Great Soda Alternative - Just don\\'t like the price! Excellent! If you\\'ve gotta have a sweet drink... Tasty soda All Natural Thought it had a great taste, but a bit pricey! Carbonated juice With a natural black cherry taste, it\\'s all about tasting the meat. Great taste, with a hint of apple OK, not great. Great! This tastes more like apples than cherries! Fizzy, with no artificial ingredients! Pleasantly surprised! Surprised by full flavor-found it better than ice Mmmmmm . . . Refreshing and Easy to Drink What I like and what I don\\'t like Make The Switch you beverage of chioce. Juicy Juice with carbonation Carbonated Black cherry juice in a can Grown up soda... MMM.. smells like cherries Taste, the Final Test Not worth 130 calories Tart black cherry is refreshing Just plain sugar water Feh Delicious Black Cherry Soda This really is a \"Switch\" Dark Cherry Juice Soda Better than expected, but not perfect Bait and Switch Great taste! Great!! great taste, 100% juice, a bit sweet Taste great.... A very delicious black cherry soda Very sweet, fizzy drink Great flavor, not overly powerful SODA \"ALTERNATIVE\" STILL PACKS A POWERFUL PUNCH Flavorful and refreshing A bit too sweet for my liking Black Cherry is an Awesome Flavor for an Awesome Drink taste great but....... Make The Switch Sweet and tart - The Switch Black Cherry is a yummy treat, but it\\'s soooo sweet. Better than Soda but NOT Better for you. Switch Black Cherry - 8.3 Ounce Can Extremely Sweet Very refreshing, but not a flavor that I liked Ugh, too sweet Wild Cherry Beverage Refreshing! Good-tasting soda, Nice for a Special Treat tasty, all natural, but NOT low-calorie Great flavor and healthier than sodas Guilt Free Flavor!!  (With no Soybean con attached!) Good taste, right size The Switch vs. Soda I\\'m Ready to Switch! Fizzy Juice Sorry, I \"Switched\" back! Uber-Yummy Belch juice BLACK CHERRY NATURAL SODA Better with a splash of vodka I\\'ll drink, but I won\\'t switch! More of the same Not so sweet but fun to drink Different! New! Expensive Bubbling Fruit Juice Cute Idea - way too much sugar OK, a little pricey A Great, More Healthy Alternative to Soda Pop  (but I don\\'t love this flavor) Okay not great Tastes like apple juice Well, it\\'s nice that it doesn\\'t have sugar, but Reading this description you would think... Not bad, yet nothing great -- way overpriced Another great concept with not-as-great execution. Not for me. Wow! Better than I expected! Like a juice box, but in a can with bubbles. First Apple, Second Grape and then a touch of cherry flavor carbonated juice Tasty Cherry Switch At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For where\\'s the cherry? Delicious and not soda! Very good soda alternative, just expensive. They should all be called Apple Nice alternative to soda Enjoyed it. Good Cherry Flavor Great tasting drink Pretty standard fruity drink Tasty Tasty and refreshing! Tasty, but I wouldn\\'t drive out of my way for it Very pleasant Not too shabby. Switch does it again and unleashes the black cherry magic. Not Great, Not Horrible LOVE IT! Better than soda pop any day Too sweet and does not quench thirst not 100% like \"real pop\" but good Switch Black Cherry If you\\'re into Black Cherry, or Cherry Coke VERY cherry, yummy and healthy drink! My kids love it ------Taste is great and Switch is 100% juice------ good idea, so-so product Pretty good, but not enough beverage alternative to colas Much better than plain juice! Average Tasting (Like Apple Juice) Drink with 130 Calories A fruity refreshment Good with a slight after-taste Good balance of fizziness and 100% fruity goodness High sugar black cherry drink So good, so fresh pretty good stuff - but not enough to \"switch\" Black Cherry is my favorite of the Switch Drinks Not so cherry Very good cherry taste, but a little too sweet A nice change of pace from soda The first sip was divine.
